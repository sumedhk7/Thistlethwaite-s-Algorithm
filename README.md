Thistlethwaite's algorithm is a solution for solving the Rubik's Cube puzzle. It works by reducing the puzzle to a series of progressively simpler subgroups. The algorithm breaks the solving process into four phases, each progressively constraining the puzzle's state, making it easier to reach the final solved state.
Explanation:
Cube Representation: The RubiksCube class uses a string state to represent the cube's state. This is a simplification. In a real implementation, you'd use arrays or a similar structure to model the cube's facelets and pieces.

Move Application: The applyMove function appends the move to the state. In a real scenario, this should perform actual state transitions, altering the cube's representation to reflect moves.

Phase Check: The inPhase function is used to check if the cube meets the conditions for a specific phase. This is simplified for the demonstration.

BFS Search: The bfs function explores all possible moves in the given phase to find a solution that meets phase conditions.

Solve Function: The solveRubiksCube function sequentially applies BFS for each phase, transitioning the cube state from phase 1 through phase 4.

Important Considerations:
Actual Move Logic: Implementing the real logic for cube moves requires handling rotations and facelet changes accurately.
Performance: The BFS approach can be slow. In practice, optimizations such as pruning unnecessary moves and using precomputed tables would be essential.
Data Structures: A realistic implementation might use more sophisticated data structures to efficiently manage cube states and transitions.
This code provides a structural approach to Thistlethwaite's algorithm and serves as a starting point for further development and optimization.
